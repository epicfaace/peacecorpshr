    <title>Peace Corps Platform of Demands</title>
    </head>
    <body>
            <p>Introduction</p>
            <p>The purpose of this platform is to fundamentally alter the Peace Corps’ policies, practices, and culture as the agency returns to field operations. The demands broadly address the Peace Corps’ systems, programming, and approaches to sex- and gender-based violence (“SGBV”). </p>
            <p>Each demand is broad because issues of SGBV are interconnected with overarching problems at play within the Peace Corps; for implementation to be meaningful, it must also be intersectional. Where the Peace Corps has failed to implement policies and laws already in place, the demands reiterate those laws and policies to stress the inadequacy of the current status quo. This list is not exhaustive, and fulfillment of the demands would not “fix” the Peace Corps. Rather, they represent a starting point: the necessary foundations for true change.</p>
            <p>A cross-section of SGBV survivors and other activists and community members created this platform through a series of town hall events in the fall of 2021. The demands also draw on complaints published by the Instagram account <u>@PeaceCorpsHR</u>, the <u>four</u> <u>recent</u> <i><u>USA Today</i></u> <u>stories</u>, data from the Peace Corps’ <u>Annual Reports of Crimes Against Volunteers</u>, <u>reports by the Office of the Inspector General</u> (“OIG”) for the Peace Corps, <u>reports by the Sexual Assault Advisory Council</u> (“SAAC”), and the Peace Corps’ responses to FOIA requests. The platform incorporates as many voices and perspectives as possible; for explanations or to submit feedback or additions, email PeaceCorpsHR@gmail.com.</p>

            <p>Detailed Demands</p>

            <h1>1. The Peace Corps must request that Congress universally reclassify PCV/Ts as federal employees, with commensurate rights and protections.</h1>

            <h1>2. The Peace Corps must create an Office of Volunteer Resources (“OVR”).</h1>
            <p><b>2-1.</b> The Office of Volunteer Resources must be structured as follows:</p>
            <ol><li>The Office of Volunteer Resources must be an independent office within the Office of the Director or the Office of the Inspector General;</li>
            <li>The Office of Volunteer Resources must be staffed as follows:</li>
            <ol><li>A Director of Global Operations, based in D.C.;</li>
            <li>Four support staff to the Director: </li>
            <ol><li>Three support staff assigned to the Peace Corps regions (one each to Africa; Europe, Mediterranean, & Asia; and Inter-America & Pacific) and working from D.C. in staggered shifts, to match the time zones of the region to which they are assigned; </li>
            <li>One staff member to coordinate the global Volunteer Advisory Committees and Peer Support Networks;</li>
            <li>At least one licensed mental health professional Volunteer Resource Officer, (“VRO”) answerable solely to the Office of Volunteer Resources and not to post staff, stationed at each post with the following mandate: </li>
            <ol><li>Help PCV/Ts manage the difficulties of service from the post headquarters as well as by periodically traveling to visit PCV/Ts at their sites;</li>
            <li>Advocate on behalf of PCV/Ts to staff as needed, including but not limited to: site changes, resources, administrative issues, and PCV/T reports regarding safety and security concerns;</li>
            <li>Write annual reports regarding the types of complaints they receive, overall trends at the post, and issues forwarded to the OIG;</li>
            <li>Manage violations of the <u>Standards of Conduct agreement</u>, ideally through a restorative justice model, including but not limited to: additional training, facilitated meditations between the affected party and the party at fault, and issued apologies;</li>
            <li>In order to maintain independence, VROs will not otherwise be involved in day-to-day post operations or staff decisions.</li>
            <li>Following initial staff appointments, only OVR personnel may propose office budgets and make hiring and firing decisions, pursuant to Congressional oversight.</li>
            <li>No person shall be permitted to work simultaneously for the OVR and the Peace Corps in any other capacity at any time.</li></ol>
            <h1>3. The Peace Corps must implement a new system for PCV/Ts to anonymously report safety and security incidents as they occur; the agency must use that data to self-assess and implement changes as necessary.</h1>
            <p><b>3-1. </b>The safety and security reporting system must be structured as follows:</p>
            <ol><li>The system must be managed solely by headquarters OVR staff, who may access and track all reports and must publish annual findings on aggregate data, both globally and broken down by post, with specific recommendations where necessary.</li>
            <li>The system must be fully functional online; where internet access is intermittent, posts must establish a parallel paper system by which PCV/Ts can mail or hand-deliver written reports to their post Volunteer Resource Officer for processing;</li>
            <li>The system must allow PCV/Ts complete anonymity through the following measures:</li>
            <ol><li>The system must be managed by a third-party contractor which generates login credentials to be distributed to invitees at staging; no Peace Corps staffer may ever access or record login credentials or user information;</li>
            <li>The system must generate a unique code each time a PCV/T files a report, so that reports cannot be correlated with a particular user over time;</li>
            <li>The system must allow PCV/Ts to choose between:</li>
            <ol><li> An open report, which permits the post Volunteer Resource Officer, the headquarters Office of Volunteer Resources, and relevant post staff under the Kate Puzey Act to view and interact with the report;</li>
            <li>A restricted report, which permits the post Volunteer Resource Officer, the headquarters Office of Volunteer Resources, and relevant post staff under the Kate Puzey Act to view and interact with the report;</li>
            <li>A fully anonymous report, which permits only the headquarters Office of Volunteer Resources to view and interact with data entirely dissociated from any personally identifying information;</li>
            <li>The system must further:</li>
            <ol><li>Allow PCV/Ts to access, view the status of, and edit their reports; </li>
            <li>Create a log of changes to each report, attributed to the user making them (e.g. SSM, Volunteer Advocate, PCV/T reporter) and attached to the report, viewable to every system user at all times, to create accountability and ensure that reports are accurately categorized and incorporated into annual data; </li>
            <li>Permit PCV/Ts to appeal classification decisions;</li>
            <li>Be open to collecting <i>any</i> type of report a PCV/T wishes to file, whether the Volunteer or trainee has experienced or witnessed a violation of the Standards of Conduct agreement, suspicious activity they wish to alert the agency about, criminal activity, or simply has other data they seek to share with the agency;</li>
            <li>Staff must encourage PCV/Ts to report all safety and security incidents they witness or experience, whether criminal or not, in order to gain a more accurate picture of the conditions future PCV/Ts will face and how best to support and advise them.</li></ol>
            <h1>4. The Peace Corps must collect and publish additional data from Volunteers and trainees about their experiences.</h1>
            <p><b>4-1. </b>The Peace Corps must follow OSS5 in the <u>SAAC 2015-2021 Report</u> to implement best practices generally, and to collect and publish the following information:</p>

            <li>Voyeurism (“peeping Tom” incidents; invasions of PCV/Ts’ private spaces);</li>
            <li>Psychological violence (gaslighting, controlling behavior, threats of violence);</li>
            <li>Physical gender-based violence (unwanted touching, intimate partner abuse);</li>
            <li>Sexual violence, which should be expanded to include forced witnessing of sexual activity and acts involving “revenge porn” or other sexual retaliation;</li>
            <li>Sexual harassment (jokes, catcalling, hate speech, slurs, rumors, humiliation);</li>
            <li>Socioeconomic violence (taking resources on gendered bases, e.g. partner abuse);</li>
            <li>Harassment or hate speech on the basis of an identity (racial and ethnic slurs and colorism; homophobia; ableism; sexism; ageism; religious slurs; etc.)</li>
